# Meeting Process and Tools (Scrum)

The team's main tool will be GitHub for uploading issues (tasks/backlog items), pushing to repo, doing PR:s. In addition to that will Azure Devops Boards be integrated to better enhance the visibility of the backlog, sprint backlog and time estimation. This will mainly be used by the Scrum Master to keep the team in a rythm.

**Meeting Process**
|   Type of Meeting	|   Day & Time	|   Description	|   
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|   Spring Planning	|   Mondays, Time: TBD	|   Product owner discusses which backlog item/tasks that should be moved from the backlog to the sprint backlog and the priority of them. This takes place before the sprint.	| 
|   Dailys	|   Mon-Fri, Time: 13:00	|   Go through the sprint backlog and our taskboard. Each member gives an update on their work and informs the rest of the team on whats been achieved and potential problems etc etc. This takes place during the sprint. 	|   	|   	|
|   Refinement of the backlog	|   In connection with dailys when necessary	|   Break down tasks to even smaller tasks in order to accomplish more complex tasks. Fill in missing estimation etc.	|   	|   	|
|   Sprint demo & sprint summary	|   Fridays, Time: TBD	|   A presentation for the product owner and stakeholders on what has been achieved during the sprint in order to be able to close the sprint. Once its closed and before the next sprint is a summary session where we discuss what went well and what could be done better and so on.	|   	|   	|



## How Should a Sprint Backlog Item Look Like

**Title** - There will be a title for every item which indicates what type of item it is.
**Description** - A short description that describes the item.
**ID** - Every item will be connected to and ID which can be referenced in PR:s etc etc.
**Label/Tag** - Label the task accordingly. Is it a bug, feature, improvement etc.
**State** - In what state is the task in? To Do, Doing, Done.
**Assignee** - The person responsible for the task.
**Time estimation** - How long is the task estimated to be in hours.



## Definition of Done

As stated during the meeting, our definition of done is when all the tasks for a backlog item are in the "Done" category and the PR is reviewed and approved by another developer and when our test lead has confirmed that the change/feature/bug/improvement has passed all the necessary tests. Then and only then can it be merged.

## Goals for Sprint 0

 - Have a first meeting and go through a initial work and meeting flow.
 - Get the legacy system running.
 - Clarify how we will use Scrum as a work method.
 - Set our definition of done.

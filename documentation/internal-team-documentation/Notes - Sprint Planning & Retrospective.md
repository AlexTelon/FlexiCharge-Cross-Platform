# Notes - Sprint Planning & Retrospective
**Sprint 1**
- The Sprint backlog is set for Sprint 1.
- We agreed upon prioritizing to get all of the legacy system up and running (both devices) for all team members and test lead before starting any of the other sprint backlog items
- Since some of the team members have had trouble getting it to work on both devices, time estimation of the items will be done during a daily meeting instead.
- Once that is done the backlog item regarding changing the splashscreen package to a newer version has to be handled.
- Google maps API key is currently being handled by Alex and Robin.
- Test lead have an important item this Sprint regarding updating the workflow yaml file so pushes to the repo goes through properly without complaining.

  **Retrospective Summery Sprint 1**
  - The application is now fully functional on both devices, with two new UIs implemented. Deprecated dependencies and packages have been updated, and crucial documentation was received. The Scrum method is streamlining development, and cross-platform and native squads are aligning efforts. However, backlog grooming for Sprint 2 needs improvement, and communication with late arrivals must be enhanced. The team had a positive feeling during the retrospective, and a new Git workflow was introduced, but the Google Maps API key is still pending. Reflecting on the product, there were successes in UI development and documentation, but delays in documentation delivery and missing API keys were noted. Technology updates and Git workflow implementation were positive, though repository updates took time. The Scrum process has been fully adapted, with open dialogue and constructive feedback. Overall, the team is making progress, but there's room for improvement in certain areas, particularly in communication and documentation management.

  **Sprint 2**
  - The Sprint backlog is set for Sprint 2.
  - We agreed on putting our focus on UI related items and once they are done switch the focus to the backend functionality for these UI related items.
  - 3 backlog items regarding bug fixing is also on the agenda for this sprint but they will be focused later in the sprint.
  - A lot of backlog items regarding testing is also on the table for this sprint.
  - The native squad also has their focus on UI related backlog items this sprint so that our squads work towards the same direction.

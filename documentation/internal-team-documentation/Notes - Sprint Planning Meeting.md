# Notes - Sprint Planning Meeting
**Sprint 1**
- The Sprint backlog is set for Sprint 1.
- We agreed upon prioritizing to get all of the legacy system up and running (both devices) for all team members and test lead before starting any of the other sprint backlog items
- Since some of the team members have had trouble getting it to work on both devices, time estimation of the items will be done during a daily meeting instead.
- Once that is done the backlog item regarding changing the splashscreen package to a newer version has to be handled.
- Google maps API key is currently being handled by Alex and Robin.
- Test lead have an important item this Sprint regarding updating the workflow yaml file so pushes to the repo goes through properly without complaining.

## Setup
Follow instructions on: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install, to set up your flutter environment.

Make sure flutter is installed on you system. Check for errors by running `flutter doctor` in a terminal. If Flutter is not installed, follow your respective operating system install guide on the Flutter website.

Download the project by either cloning it or by downloading the zip-file. After extracting the project, open it up with Visual Studio Code.

### VS Code
Make sure that the extension Flutter is installed and enabled.

If you get prompted that some packages are missing, press download. Else, go to pubspec.yaml and and download the packages from there, or download from the terminal by entering `flutter pub get`

The app can now be started with either the command `flutter run` or by going to main.dart. If you have a connected supported Android or IOS device, or an emulator up and running, the app should launch fine. :)
